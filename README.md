**Simon**:
>I intend to build a device similar to the popular memory game Simon using LEDs and buttons.

**Summary**
>Simon is a small device set in a box or on a platform that lights up LEDs one at a time in a random sequence.  “Players” mimic that sequence by pressing the button associated with the correct LED.  With each correct round, the number of times an LED lights up increases.  For example, Round 1 will have a sequence of one LED lit.  After a successful Round 1, Round 2 will have a sequence of two LEDs light up. The pattern repeats until the Player mimics the sequence incorrectly. 

>The game would have a set number of levels.  The goal of the Player is to get to the last level by mimicking all sequences.

**Component Parts**
>breadboard

>wires

>LEDs (red, yellow, green, blue)

>4 push buttons

>resistors 

>foam board

**Challenges**
>The hardest part, I think, will be the coding. Coding for Arduino is new for me, so I think I’ll be asking for a lot of help or looking up a lot of things online.

**Timeline**
>What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks? Your goal is to solve the scary problems as quickly as possible!
	•	Week 1: Write proposal
	•	Week 2: Gather tools, wires, inputs, outputs, all other materials. Build breadboard/put components on breadboard.
	•	Week 3: Make a cut out so wires are hidden. Code game.
	•	Week 4: Finalize code.
	•	Week 5: Present!
